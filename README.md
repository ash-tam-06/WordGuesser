# WordGuesser

This program is a simple word guessing game. Program randomly selects a word from a list of avaliable words, and user has to guess the randomly selected word within a certain number of tries. After each guess, the program will let user know which letters they placed correctly, and which letters are in the word but are incorrectly placed. 


Here is a link to a video to explain a little more on my project and how it works:
